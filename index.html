                <li>Membership dues should have been paid by December. $20000.00/hero. Please get a membership form from
                    Pepper Potts. The form and dues may be mailed to: Pepper Potts (just get FRIDAY to send it)</li>
                <li>Feed your hives on good days to get them through the next 2 months. Make sure your hives have some
                    ventilation to keep the condensation down. Queens are beginning to lay now. It’s time to introduce some bee
                    pollen to your sugar patty. Stark Industries Ultra Bee, AP23. L.V. uses Arc Reactor Flour. Order online <a href="https://www.starkindustriescorporation.com/">here</a>!</li>
                <li>If possible, now is the time to treat your hives with Oxalic Acid on days that the bees are flying. Also be thinking
                    about what Varroa mite treatments you want to use later this Spring when honey supers are on. You can use
                    Mite-a-way when temps stay consistently above 50F at night but don’t exceed 80-85 during the day</li>
                <li>Beekeepers of Southwest Manhattan will meet the third Thursday of each month (next meeting: March 21). 6-8
                    PM 10880 Malibu Point in Point Dume, Malibu, CA. Guest Speaker will be
                    Bruce Banner, biologist/beekeeper from Culver.</li>
                <li>Please see Thor if you ordered a club shirt.</li>
                <li>The Guardians Galaxy Beekeepers has a new President, Peter Quill who is a member of Avengers Beekeepers.
                    Meetings are the 1st Monday of every month at 7 PM.</li>

                <li>Bee School was a success with a smaller but more manageable crowd. Our extra food went to the Women’s
                    and Men’s Shelters here in Manhattan thanks to Natasha Romanoff who delivered the excess food. We’ll be
                    spending the next few months taking suggestions on how to spread the word about Bee School more effectively
                    and perhaps implementing on-line registration to respond more effectively to what the public wants. </li>
                <li>Nat has  put Bee School photos on the website and had a slide show of the school at the meeting. Thanks
                    Nat for all you do!</li>
                <li>Thanks to everyone who helped with the school. Due to the club response, we had enough worker bees to
                    spread the load and the set-up and tear down was accomplished very quickly. THANK YOU ALL!</li>
                <li>Peter Parker and Michelle Jones attended the Midtown School in Midtown Manhattan. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>If you need queens now is the time to order. Clint Barton will have some Asgardian Queens
                    April 18th. Cost: $300.00. He will also have some that he and Kate have bred which should be available in
                    mid to late May. If you are interested, please get in touch with him as soon as possible. </li>
                <li>If you plan on ordering nucleus colonies it is best to get the order in soon. Wanda Maximoff will be selling some nucs.
                    Stephen Strange also plans to see some and Darcy Lewis will have some
                    available.</li>
                <li>Now is the time for equipment maintenance and painting.</li>
                <li>Temperatures should be favorable on Wednesday for checking Queen laying patterns and to determine if you
                    need to rotate your boxes. If you’re not sure about rotating boxes then leave them as they are and make sure
                    they have food. If you decide to rotate boxes, again, make sure to place a shim and put some sugar patty with
                    bee pollen between the rotated frames so your bees have a food source if the temps dip.</li>
                <li>We have two members, James Rhodes and Bucky Barnes, selling equipment and supplies so think about checking with them when you need
                    beekeeping items </li>
